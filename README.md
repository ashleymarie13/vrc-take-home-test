I used Create React App to create the project.
I focused on the functionality not the styling so it looks pretty bare bones so beware (but that just means its in theme with spooky season o.O )

The main functionality works except for a few edge casesand it only returns 10 results at time without any pagination.
- I intended to render the image thumbnails for each of world results so that is why there is a place holder image
- Some components were hard coded and not dynamic because I was running out of time. 

Thanks, it was cool using the VRC api
